# Project: Numeric Matrix Processor
### About:
Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding a determinant and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.
### Learning outcomes
Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will get familiar with Math library, recursion and the many ways of using arrays in practice.
### This project is a part of the following track
Kotlin Developer
## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn
### Stage 1/6: Addition
With the help of multi-dimensional arrays, learn to add up matrices by element.
### Stage 2/6: Multiplication by number
Learn to multiply a matrix by a number and display the result
### Stage 3/6: Matrix by matrix multiplication
Multiply matrices and create a menu where you can list all the awesome abilities of your processor.
### Stage 4/6: Transpose
Add another useful operation to your processor: allow matrix transposition and add this option to the menu
### Stage 5/6: Determined!
Using recursion, enable your program to find the determinant.
### Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix
Yet another possible operation for is finding an inverse matrix: add this option to your program.
